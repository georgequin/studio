/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for draft reports,
 *              allows public read access for sources, categories, and departments,
 *              and requires backend-controlled transitions for saved reports.
 * @dataStructure
 *              - /users/{userId}/draft_reports/{reportId}: Draft reports owned by a specific user.
 *              - /reports/{reportId}: Finalized reports (potentially public read, owner-only write - see TODO).
 *              - /sources/{sourceId}: News sources, publicly readable.
 *              - /categories/{categoryId}: Report categories, publicly readable.
 *              - /departments/{departmentId}: NHRC departments, publicly readable.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *              - Users can only access their own draft reports.
 *              - Listing reports in the /reports collection is allowed for all users. Consider restricting.
 *              - The /sources, /categories, and /departments collections are publicly readable.
 *              - Schema validation is relaxed for prototyping, focusing on authorization.
 *              - All write operations require authentication.
 *              - All update and delete operations check for document existence.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization Path-based ownership is used for draft reports, avoiding the need for `get()` calls.
 * @structuralSegregation Draft reports are stored in a private user subcollection, while finalized reports are stored in a public top-level collection.
