/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for draft reports, while allowing public read access to sources, categories, and departments. Finalized reports require further access control configuration based on the application's needs.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/draft_reports/{reportId}: Stores draft reports, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /reports/{reportId}: Stores finalized reports. Currently, write access is denied. Consider adding a `members` map for collaborative access.
 * - /sources/{sourceId}: Stores news sources. Publicly readable.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Stores report categories. Publicly readable.
 * - /departments/{departmentId}: Stores department information. Publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User-owned draft reports are secured via path-based ownership.
 * - Listing of draft reports is restricted to the owning user.
 * - Finalized reports in `/reports` are currently not writable without further configuration (e.g., adding a `members` map).
 * - Sources, Categories, and Departments are publicly readable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Path-based ownership in `/users/{userId}/draft_reports/{reportId}` eliminates the need for `get()` calls to verify ownership.
