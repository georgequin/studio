/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for draft reports, while allowing public read access to sources, categories, departments and reports.
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}/draft_reports/{reportId}: Stores draft reports, accessible only by the owning user.
 * - /reports/{reportId}: Stores finalized reports. Publicly readable, but create, update, and delete are restricted to the owner.
 * - /sources/{sourceId}: Stores news sources. Publicly readable.
 * - /categories/{categoryId}: Stores report categories. Publicly readable.
 * - /departments/{departmentId}: Stores departments. Publicly readable.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Draft reports are strictly owned by the user and stored under their userId.
 * - Reports collection is publicly readable to allow for open access.
 * - Sources, categories, and departments are publicly readable to allow ease of querying for all users.
 * - Write access to the reports collection is restricted to the owner of the report, based on the userId.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 * - Reports documents have the userId denormalized onto the document to avoid the need for additional `get()` calls in the security rules.
 * @structuralSegregation
 * - Private draft reports are stored in a user subcollection, while public reports are stored in a top-level collection.
